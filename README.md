# 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Understanding the needs of users forms the basis for any good design to fulfill a customer's expectations. For example, during the SNHU Travel project, I was tasked to work closely with the Product Owner and other stakeholders in identifying what features hurt and pleased the user, along with overall objectives. This information gathered was translated into user stories, indicating those needs so that the development team would understand what was supposed to be built and why. Creation of user stories helped split complex requirements into manageable pieces of work, enabling them to focus on small-scale concrete features. For example, after the client asked for additional mobile app features midway into the project, we updated the user stories in the product backlog, prioritized them accordingly, and made sure the team was able to adapt without derailing progress. User stories make sure that the development work is aligned with the client's vision while allowing room for flexibility as priorities shift.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to program development emphasizes iterative progress, clear communication, and collaboration. I start off by gathering the requirements and breaking them down into user stories, ensuring each feature addresses the core user needs. In my development, I ensure that there is communication amongst the team members and with the stakeholders. I seek feedback frequently in order to make improvements on the product. In future projects, I plan to implement the Agile process such as continuous integration, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. This will help me stay flexible and adapt to changes fast, delivering value in small frequent chunks. In addition, revisiting work and making necessary refinements on the process help to better align the team with the users of their creations while bringing in efficiency in performance over time.

# 3. What does being a good team member entail regarding software development?

In software development, a good team member actively participates to ensure the success of others by sharing in teamwork, collaboration, and maintaining a sense of direction towards common goals. In the SNHU Travel project, we solved problems as a team, like when we pair-programmed to solve complex coding challenges. A good team member is communicative, transparent, and open to feedback. Much of the success in this project was due to the team's ability to discuss progress and potential blockers during daily stand-ups. Additionally, being willing to take on diverse tasks, offer assistance to others, and prioritize the teamâ€™s needs over individual preferences is crucial. In Scrum, every team member plays an important role, and the collective effort drives the project toward completion.
